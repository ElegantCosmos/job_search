It recently came to my attention that the Intensity Frontier group at your
Institution has an opening for an assistant physicist position on the Mu2e
experiment. I would like to apply for the position.

I received my Ph.D. in experimental neutrino physics from the University of
Hawaii at Manoa in April, 2016. There I worked on a novel event track
reconstruction and particle ID technique in KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid
Scintillator Antineutrino Detector), a monolithic liquid scintillator neutrino
detector in Kamioka, Japan. Through my work, I single handedly opened the doors
to a never before explored capability of scintillator detectors to conduct
indirect dark matter searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from
the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the
first ever physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in
scintillator. A paper for this is currently under preparation.

%Nevertheless, topological event reconstruction in scintillator is fundamentally
%limited because the reconstruction is done using the smeared information of
%isotropically emitted scintillation photons collected by photomultiplier tubes
%(PMTs) along the perimeter of the detector volume. Liquid Argon
%Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) technology that will be used by the DUNE (Deep
%Underground Neutrino Experiment) detector at Sanford Lab is the next
%generation endeavor to employ topological event imaging at an unprecedented
%level of precision, using the ability to drift ionization charge to a read-out
%plane. Although there has been much effort to demonstrate the feasibility of
%the detector technology itself, development of reliable event imaging
%algorithms will be crucial to the success of DUNE. I believe that my experience
%with topological event imaging in an extremely difficult medium, such as
%scintillator, puts me in a unique position to play a leading role in the effort
%to develop reliable reconstruction algorithms in LArTPCs.

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground
Observatory for Rare Events) $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment at LNGS (Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso), Italy. CUORE is an unprecedented tonne-scale
bolometric search for lepton number violation in \ce{^{130}Te}. The experiment
was successfully upgraded last year increasing its detector mass by a factor of
almost 20. A paper of our first $0\nu\beta\beta$ analysis with this increased
mass was submitted for publication to PRL in late 2017.
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

%The sensitivity of CUORE is expected to start probing the inverted neutrino
%mass hierarchy phase space of the effective Majorana neutrino mass within the
%next 5 years of data taking. However, In order to advance further, we are
%confronted with the challenge of further reducing our background in the region
%of interest by more than \num{2} orders of magnitude that the current level of \SI{\sim 0.01}{\text{count}\per\kilo\electronvolt\per\kilo\gram\per\year}. I
%am currently spearheading the effort on precision modeling of the alpha
%background spectrum to better understand our radioactive backgrounds to meet
%this challenge.

%In addition, throughout my academic career, I have been heavily involved in
%teaching and mentoring students. My philosophy for teaching is motivation
%through curiosity and mastering through repetition. When teaching at the
%undergraduate level, it is especially important to never get bogged down by the
%equation or numbers. When I begin a class or introduce a new concept to
%students, I never begin with equations. I always first show them the experiment
%itself or introduce the context in an illustrative way. This is to engage the
%students' interest and entice their curiosity to develop a long lasting
%motivation before starting to learn. Repetition is the key to mastering a
%topic. No matter how gifted one may be, no one able to master everything
%instantaneously in a single trial. On the other hand, this also means that even
%if one is not naturally gifted at something, it can be mastered through
%diligent repetition.

%In society today, there is an unfortunate misconception that Physics is a
%difficult subject and that it is only for \textit{smart} students. Nothing
%could be further from the truth. When students feel that they are not good
%enough or smart enough to follow the class, it is important to let them know
%that Physics is not about intelligence, but about curiosity driven diligence
%and hard work. All professional Physicists today stand on the shoulders of the
%giants of the past, and almost no research is done solely alone, but through
%collaboration and teamwork. No one is \textit{smart} enough to do all the work
%by one's self. I usually use myself as an example. I could not attend a leading
%world-class research institute during my undergraduate school days, but I
%believe through diligence and hard work, I have had the opportunity to work
%with some of the most talented and innovative Physicists in the field.

%In conclusion, my innovative endeavors in topological neutrino event
%reconstruction, as well as my experience in successfully teaching/mentoring
%students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, makes me a unique
%candidate to apply for your position. I believe I can make a significant impact
%to your team of academic and scientific prowess at SD School of Mines \&
%Technology.

My experience being involved in the commissioning phase of 2 world-class
particle physics experiments, as well as my innovative accomplishments in
developing novel methods for problem solving makes me a unique candidate to
apply for your position. I believe I can make a significant impact to your team
of academic and scientific prowess in your group at ANL.


Thank you for your consideration.
