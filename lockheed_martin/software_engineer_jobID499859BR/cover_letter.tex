As a motivated technologist, I am interested in joining your team as a Software
Engineer to help protect our nation. I would like to apply for position ID
499859BR.

I am currently a post-doctoral scholar at the University of California,
Berkeley with expertise in software development and computational physics
simulations working in the area of particle/nuclear physics.

%CUORE is an unprecedented tonne-scale
%bolometric search for lepton number violation in \ce{^{130}Te}. The experiment
%was successfully upgraded last year increasing its detector mass by a factor of
%almost 20. A paper of our first $0\nu\beta\beta$ analysis with this increased
%mass was submitted for publication to PRL in late 2017.
%(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

%The sensitivity of CUORE is expected to start probing the inverted neutrino
%mass hierarchy phase space of the effective Majorana neutrino mass within the
%next 5 years of data taking. However, In order to advance further, we are
%confronted with the challenge of further reducing our background in the region
%of interest by more than \num{2} orders of magnitude that the current level of \SI{\sim 0.01}{\text{count}\per\kilo\electronvolt\per\kilo\gram\per\year}. I
%am currently spearheading the effort on precision modeling of the alpha
%background spectrum to better understand our radioactive backgrounds to meet
%this challenge.

%I received my Ph.D. in experimental neutrino physics from the University of
%Hawaii at Manoa in May of 2016. During my graduate studies, I worked on event
%track reconstruction and particle ID techniques in KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid
%Scintillator Antineutrino Detector), a monolithic liquid scintillator neutrino
%detector in Kamioka, Japan. Through my work, I single handedly opened the doors
%to a never before explored capability of scintillator detectors to conduct
%indirect dark matter searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from
%the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the
%first ever physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in
%scintillator. A paper for this is currently under preparation.
%
%Nevertheless, topological event reconstruction in scintillator is fundamentally
%limited because the reconstruction is done using the smeared information of
%isotropically emitted scintillation photons collected by photomultiplier tubes
%(PMTs) along the perimeter of the detector volume. Liquid Argon
%Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) technology that will be used by the DUNE (Deep
%Underground Neutrino Experiment) detector at Sanford Lab is the next
%generation endeavor to employ topological event imaging at an unprecedented
%level of precision, using the ability to drift ionization charge to a read-out
%plane. Although there has been much effort to demonstrate the feasibility of
%the detector technology itself, development of reliable event imaging
%algorithms will be crucial to the success of DUNE. I believe that my experience
%with topological event imaging in an extremely difficult medium, such as
%scintillator, puts me in a unique position to play a leading role in the effort
%to develop reliable reconstruction algorithms in LArTPCs.

%In addition, throughout my academic career, I have been heavily involved in
%teaching and mentoring students. My philosophy for teaching is motivation
%through curiosity and mastering through repetition. When teaching at the
%undergraduate level, it is especially important to never get bogged down by the
%equation or numbers. When I begin a class or introduce a new concept to
%students, I never begin with equations. I always first show them the experiment
%itself or introduce the context in an illustrative way. This is to engage the
%students' interest and entice their curiosity to develop a long lasting
%motivation before starting to learn. Repetition is the key to mastering a
%topic. No matter how gifted one may be, no one able to master everything
%instantaneously in a single trial. On the other hand, this also means that even
%if one is not naturally gifted at something, it can be mastered through
%diligent repetition.

%In society today, there is an unfortunate misconception that Physics is a
%difficult subject and that it is only for \textit{smart} students. Nothing
%could be further from the truth. When students feel that they are not good
%enough or smart enough to follow the class, it is important to let them know
%that Physics is not about intelligence, but about curiosity driven diligence
%and hard work. All professional Physicists today stand on the shoulders of the
%giants of the past, and almost no research is done solely alone, but through
%collaboration and teamwork. No one is \textit{smart} enough to do all the work
%by one's self. I usually use myself as an example. I could not attend a leading
%world-class research institute during my undergraduate school days, but I
%believe through diligence and hard work, I have had the opportunity to work
%with some of the most talented and innovative Physicists in the field.

%In conclusion, my innovative endeavors in topological neutrino event
%reconstruction, as well as my experience in successfully teaching/mentoring
%students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, makes me a unique
%candidate to apply for your position. I believe I can make a significant impact
%to your team of academic and scientific prowess at SD School of Mines \&
%Technology.
