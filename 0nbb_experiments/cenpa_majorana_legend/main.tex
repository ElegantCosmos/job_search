I recently received word from one of my colleagues of a post-doctoral position
opening at CENPA. I would like to apply for the position.

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground
Observatory for Rare Events) $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment at LNGS (Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso), Italy leading the effort on precision modeling of
the alpha background contamination of the detector, and the bolometer thermal
signals in a cryogenic environment. I have also been heavily involved in the
optimization of the signal processing for the recent upgrade from CUORE-0 to
CUORE which increased the detector mass by a factor of almost 20. A paper for
our first $0\nu\beta\beta$ analysis using CUORE data was submitted for
publication in late 2017, and is currently under review
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

Previously, I have also worked on event track reconstruction and particle ID
techniques in liquid scintillator at KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid Scintillator
Antineutrino Detector) in Kamioka, Japan. This work involved an unprecedented
dark matter search by looking for a directional signal of neutrino fluxes from
the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the
first ever physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in
scintillator. A paper for this is currently under preparation.

My interest in the development of novel neutrino detection techniques, as
well as experience in the commissioning phase of ultra-low background detectors,
makes me a unique candidate for your position.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further
information. Thank you for your consideration.
