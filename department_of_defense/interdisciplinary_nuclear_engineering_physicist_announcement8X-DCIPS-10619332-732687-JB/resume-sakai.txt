Summary
* Extensive experience in particle/nuclear physics and modeling/simulation.
* Proficient in large-scale analytical/statistical data analysis and algorithm
  software development with 8 years of experience.
* Innovative problem solving skills with the ability to interface original work
  with larger collaboration.

Experience
* Post-doctoral Researcher, UC Berkeley (June 2018 - Present)
  - 40 Hours/Week
  - $56,600/Year
  - Data analysis lead for alpha decay energy spectrum of radioactive nuclei.
  - Supervisor for simulation/modeling of photon interactions with optical
    wavelength shifters.
* Post-doctoral Researcher, UCLA (March 2016 - June 2018)
  - 40 Hours/Week
  - $54,309/Year
  - Lead developer of precision radioactive alpha decay spectrum model to
    improve characterization of backgrounds in neutrinoless double beta decay
    physics experiment.
  - Mentor for 2 PhD students to simulate radiation shielding structures to
    mitigate gamma/beta backgrounds for next generation neutrinoless double
    beta decay experiments requiring ultra-low radiation environments.
* Research Assistant, University of Hawaii at Manoa (August 2009 - May 2016)
  - 40 Hours/Week
  - $22,140/Year
  - Spearheaded development of novel directional neutrino detection algorithms
    in scintillator and demonstrated with data for the first time that this can
    be applied to conduct indirect dark matter searches. First ever physics
    application of neutrino directionality in scintillator.
  - Lead developer of detector simulation code to conducted case studies of
    neutron capture doping agents in solid scintillator. Simulation results
    were later used to oversee detector design and construction.
* Teaching Assistant, University of Hawaii at Manoa (August 2007 - May 2009)
  - 20 Hours/Week
  - $22,140/Year
  - Planned coursework and taught 2 weekly physics laboratory curriculum for
    classes of over 20 students each for 3 semesters. Received especially
    positive reviews for clarity of explanation of material and teaching style.
