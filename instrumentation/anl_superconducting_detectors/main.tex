I recently received word of an opening at the High Energy Physics Division at
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) from one of my colleagues for a postdoctoral
research associate position in the experimental cosmology group focusing on the
development of superconducting detectors. I would like to apply for the
position.

I have worked at the University of California, Los Angeles with Prof. Huan
Zhong Huang as a postdoctoral researcher from April, 2016, with CUORE
(Cryogenic Underground Observatory forRare Events) at LNGS (Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso), Italy working on Monte Carlo studies of backgrounds
coming from radioactive contamination of the detector and modeling thermal
pulse signals of bolometers in a cryogenic environment, as well as various
signal processing algorithms.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii in 2016 working on track
reconstruction and particle ID algorithms in liquid scintillator at KamLAND
(Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector) in Kamioka, Japan. My
dissertation was on indirect dark matter search by looking for a directional
excess of neutrino fluxes from the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my
understanding, this work is the first ever physics application of neutrino
directionality in scintillator. A paper of this work is currently under
preparation.

My experience working with CUORE and my interest in exploring new detector
technologies toward the upgrade to CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle
Identification: the next generation bolometric double beta decay experiment
utilizing the light channel in addition to bolometric heat detection in order
to fully explore the inverted effective Majorana neutrino mass hierarchy) puts
me in a unique position to make a significant contribution to your group.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further
information.

Thank you for your consideration.
