I recently received word from one of my colleagues of a research scientist
position opening at SNOLAB. I would like to apply for the position.

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
California, Los Angeles with the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for
Rare Events) neutrinoless double beta decay experiment at LNGS (Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso), Italy working on modeling the radioactive
contamination backgrounds of the detector and the bolometer thermal signals in a
cryogenic environment. I have also been heavily involved in the optimization of
the signal processing for the recent upgrade from CUORE-0 to CUORE which
increased the detector mass by a factor of almost 20. A paper for our first
neutrinoless double beta decay analysis using CUORE data was submitted for
publication in October, 2017, and is currently under review (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

Previously, I have also worked on event track reconstruction and particle ID
techniques in liquid scintillator at KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid Scintillator
Antineutrino Detector) in Kamioka, Japan. This work involved a dark matter
search by looking for a directional excess of neutrino fluxes from the core of
the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the first ever
physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in scintillator. A
paper for this is currently under preparation.

My interest and experience in the development of novel neutrino detection
techniques in liquid scintillator as well as R\&D in the commissioning phases
of experiments places me in a unique position to apply for your position. I
believe that I can make a significant impact to your team of scientific
expertise at SNOLAB.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further
information. Thank you for your consideration.
