\section{Statement of Research}

I developed a novel directional event reconstruction algorithm for high-energy
$\gtrsim$\si{\giga\electronvolt} scale neutrinos while working with KamLAND
(Kamioka Liquid Scintillation Antineutrino Detector), and demonstrated with
data that this technique can be applied to indirect dark matter search by
looking for a directional flux of neutrinos from the core of the Sun and Earth.
Studies done with Monte Carlo suggest that the accuracy of deducing the
neutrino direction using this new method is better than that of water-Cherenkov
detectors (the conventional method for directional neutrino detection) by
$\sim$\SI{10}{\degree} in this energy regime. This method was verified using
never before observed neutrino events spilling into KamLAND from the T2K
neutrino beam-line. The results were consistent with expectation. According to
my knowledge, this is the first ever physics application of neutrino
directionality in scintillator.

My work with KamLAND further involved demonstration of 3-dimensional
topological event imaging techniques, originally developed in the LENA (Low
Energy Neutrino Astronomy) collaboration, using data for the first time. The
$\sim$\SI{3.5}{\nano\second} timing resolution of the PMTs (photomultiplier
tubes) employed in KamLAND are not good enough to do a detailed imaging of all
the individual tracks in a neutrino event. Nevertheless
$\gtrsim$\si{\giga\electronvolt} muon tracks and high enough energy tracks in a
neutrino event were imaged as well as the overall direction of the final state
particles to resolve the incoming neutrino direction. In addition
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}x}$ profiles were investigated to perform
unprecedented particle ID studies in scintillator at these energies. A paper
employing these techiques I developed to conduct an indirect dark matter search
is currently under preparation.

I have been involved with the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare
Events) experiment at the University of California, Los Angeles since early
2016. The main objective of the CUORE experiment is to hunt for lepton number
violation by observing neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in
\ce{^{130}Te}. CUORE employs an almost 20 fold increase in detector mass
compared to its previously successful pilot experiment CUORE-0. My work in the
collaboration currently involves development of a precision background model
together with a graduate student colleague to better understand the radioactive
contaminations in the detector. The energy spectrum of the backgrounds in the
so called $\alpha$ region ($\gtrsim \SI{2.5}{\mega\electronvolt}$) exhibit
peculiar features that, if understood correctly, will better explain the types
of contamination sources and their distributions in the materials comprising
the experiment. This can help us to better understand our backgrounds and
extrapolate this new knowledge to the energy region of interest
(\SIrange{2465}{2575}{\kilo\electronvolt}) for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in
\ce{^{130}Te}. I have previously also mentored 2 undergraduate students and
worked together with them to simulate and investigate new radioactivity
shielding schemes for further background reduction in future $0\nu\beta\beta$
decay experiments that will cover the inverted hierarchy region of the
effective Majorana neutrino mass.
A paper for our first $0\nu\beta\beta$ analysis using CUORE data
was submitted for publication to PRL in late 2017, and is currently under
review (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

%In order to promote more dialogue and efficient teamwork, I have also organized
%and led weekly Physics paper discussion group sessions involving both
%undergraduate and graduate students in our laboratory at UCLA. These sessions
%have helped us not only to know our own experiment better, but to increase our
%common understanding of the overall field of experimental $0\nu\beta\beta$
%decay search. Ultimately this has been invaluable for our team to increase
%our teamwork and productivity, and become a valuable contributor to the collaboration.

%The focus of my work at the University of Hawaii has been in the directional
%detection of high energy neutrinos in scintillator and its application toward
%indirect dark matter searches, directional geo-neutrino measurements, and
%anti-nuclear proliferation techniques that involve locating the position of the
%neutrino source.
%My main interest has been in detector development and novel techniques to
%search for previously unexplored phase-space regions in neutrino physics. My
%main interest and past research experience has been in detector development
%and developing novel techniques to open new methods of exploration in neutrino
%physics. 

%In addition, I have also worked on 3 other projects: the
%\SI{1}{\kilo\tonne} liquid scintillator neutrino detection experiment KamLAND
%(Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector) in Kamioka, Japan, a
%portable \SI{2.2}{\liter} plastic scintillator neutrino detector called the
%mini-TimeCube, and scintillator R\&D for a future \SI{10}{\kilo\tonne}-scale
%deep-sea based neutrino detector HanoHano.
%
%My work in KamLAND has involved developing directional event reconstruction
%methods for high-energy $\gtrsim$\si{\giga\electronvolt} scale neutrinos and
%applying this to conduct an indirect dark matter search by looking at an excess
%flux of neutrinos from the core of the Sun and Earth. Studies done with Monte
%Carlo suggest that the accuracy of reconstructing the neutrino direction using
%this method is better than that of water-Cherenkov detectors by
%$\sim$\SI{10}{\degree} for this energy regime. This method was tested against
%initial events spilling into KamLAND from the T2K neutrino beam-line and the
%results were consistent with what was expected. I believe this is the first
%ever physics application of neutrino directionality in a scintillator
%experiment.

In addition, I have worked as the lead Geant4 simulation designer for the
mini-TimeCube collaboration at University of Hawaii at Manoa. mini-TimeCube is
an ambitious project to build the world's smallest portable neutrino detector.
In this project, I mentored 3 undergraduate students and worked in
collaboration with them to conduct case studies for optimizing the detector
design, test candidate neutron capture doping elements in plastic scintillator,
and simulate the response of the multi-channel-plate (MCP) PMTs deployed in the
detector. The studies were used during construction of the detector, and to
develop directional algorithms that are now being tested in analyses of
neutrons from test sources as well as neutrinos from nuclear reactors at NIST.
%I have also conducted simulation studies for cosmic-ray muons and long-lived
%cosmogenic background isotopes such as \ce{^{8}He} and \ce{^{9}Li}. These
%backgrounds are extremely difficult to tag due to their long life-time ($>
%\sim\si{\second}$ scale) and travel distances. The studies have been vital to
%the project. 
Working with the mini-TimeCube project has further involved designing and
fabricating PCB boards as well as contributing to the FPGA firmware for the
readout electronics. A paper summarizing our accomplishments was published in
2016 (V. A. Li et al. Invited Article: miniTimeCube. Rev. Sci. Instrum.,
87(2):021301, 2016, 1602.01405).

%Finally, my work in scintillator R\&D for HanoHano, a proposed
%\SI{10}{\kilo\tonne}-scale deep-sea based neutrino detector, involved designing
%and building apparatuses using CAD for measuring light output of Linear
%alkylbenzene (LAB) based liquid scintillators when put in large electric
%potential gradients as well as testing their light transmissivities under
%extreme temperatures and pressures such as those found in deep-sea
%environments. This project included mentoring an undergraduate student on
%techniques for shielding electronic apparatuses and working with another
%graduate student on designing and operating the cold high pressure environment
%device.

As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, I would like to
continue my research in the field of neutrino physics as well as development
and application of topological event imaging techniques in experiments such as
T2K and DUNE. My past experience developing unprecedented methods in neutrino
event reconstruction as well as experience in the commissioning phase of 2
major startup experiments makes me a promising candidate. I believe that I can
make a significant impact in your team of scientific prowess at the University
of Colorado.

%%   STATEMENT OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY AND EXPERIENCE
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%\clearpage
%\section{Statement of Teaching Philosophy and Experience}
%
%Throughout my academic career, I have been heavily involved in teaching and
%mentoring students from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. This has
%included working as a teaching assistant during my graduate studies at
%University of Hawaii at Manoa where I organized and led 2 undergraduate Physics
%Laboratory classes of over 20 students each for a total of 3 semesters. In
%addition, I have also led weekly, 2 hour long, one-on-one tutoring sessions for
%3 semesters. Student evaluations for the effectiveness of my teaching and
%ability to communicate information were ``excellent''.
%
%My philosophy for teaching can be summarized in two points: self motivated
%drive through curiosity, and mastering through iteration. Fist, when teaching
%at any level, and especially at the undergraduate level, it is very important
%to never get bogged down by the equation or numbers. When I begin a class or
%introduce a new concept to students, I always first demonstrate the experiment
%itself or introduce the context in an illustrative way. This is to engage the
%students’ interest and entice their curiosity to develop a long lasting self
%motivated drive to learn. Curiosity is where science is born from and curiosity
%is what drives science forward. This is true whether one is an freshman student
%or a Nobel laureate. Second, iteration is the key to mastering a topic. No
%matter how gifted one may be, no one is able to perfectly master a topic
%instantaneously in a single trial. On the other hand, this also means that even
%if one is not naturally gifted at something, it can be mastered through
%repetitive iteration and failure. The process of iterative learning is how the
%human brain naturally works and is the key to effective learning.
%
%As an example of the above, there was a Physics Laboratory class in which I
%needed to introduce damping of a driven harmonic oscillator in a medium with
%finite viscosity. I knew that the equations describing the physics behind this
%process could be tedious and difficult to grasp at the freshman level I was
%teaching at. But I also knew that the concepts themselves were not inherently
%hard because we all intuitively know from our experiences swimming in a pool,
%how viscous media affects forces. Before going through the equations, I turned
%on the experimental apparatus first, and asked the students what they thought
%would happen when the frequency of the driving force was modified in different
%ways, while at the same time, observing their satisfaction and surprise when
%their predictions were confirmed or debunked. This effectively created a vastly
%more engaged and thoughtful atmosphere for the class and let the students
%concentrate on the ``physics'' of the class while helping them to more
%intuitively understand the equations involved. Of course, it is equally
%important for the instructor to not ``give away'' all the answers by doing all
%the work. The students were left to make multiple failed attempts until they
%were able to get just the right settings to take successful measurements.
%
%In society today, there is an unfortunate misconception that Physics is a
%difficult subject only for \textit{smart} students. Nothing could be further
%from the truth. When students feel that they are not smart enough, it is
%important to let them know that Physics is not about intelligence, but about
%curiosity driven iterative learning. All professional Physicists stand on the
%shoulders of past giants, and almost no research today is conducted solely
%alone, but through collaboration and teamwork. No one is \textit{smart} enough
%to do all the work alone. I usually use myself as an example. I come from a
%small regional college in South Korea with very little opportunity, but through
%diligence and iterative trial, I have had the opportunity to eventually work
%with some of the brightest minds in some of the most innovative projects in the
%field of neutrino physics.
%
%Mentoring higher level graduate students may be slightly different but I
%believe the same overall approach remains the same. I have taught Geant4 Monte
%Carlo particle simulations to 3 undergraduate and 3 Ph.D. students at the
%University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My method for teaching this
%toolkit is to learn together with the students by going into the details of the
%code and doing this repetitively every week. Not all the concepts may be clear
%to students in just the first trial, but through iteratively going through and
%encountering similar problems multiple times, students will eventually
%understand and learn basic coding techniques as well as tricky concepts that
%may not have been evident at first. Here, it is important to be immersed in the
%task along with the students instead of teaching from a conventional top-down
%approach because learning how to code is not just about acquiring the skill to
%code, but about learning the culture of coding. By this I mean that there are
%certain useful tools and methods of accomplishing a task that can only be
%learned through going into gritty details and getting \textit{dirty}. As
%students grow and become more knowledgeable, they can start to develop and

%\section{Statement of Contribution to Diversity}
%
%Having spent 15 years of my adolescent life in South Korea, and being fully
%Japanese by descent, while being born in the United States, I have had the
%unique opportunity to develop an \emph{international} perspective of things
%from a very young age. My ability to converse fluently in 3 languages has also
%greatly helped me to view different people and situations from multiple angles.
%With this sort of upbringing, I have learned from an early age that not only is
%diversity important, but tolerant diversity is just as important. Somehow it is
%the human tendency in a diverse environment, whether it may be in terms of
%race, culture, language, or ideas, when proper communication cannot be made,
%for people to lump the ``other group'' into one generic category. This can be
%for better or for worse, but often times manifests itself in unproductive ways
%when team work is required to reach a common goal. Due to my background and
%abilities, I have countless times served as a mediator of sorts between
%opposing groups often times as an interpreter, translator, or just simply as a
%arbitrator.
%
%This way of thinking has served me invaluably also in my professional career to
%put myself in other peoples' shoes. I have contributed to the education of a
%diverse body of students through Physics Laboratory courses that I taught at
%University of Hawaii at Manoa for 3 semesters from 2007 to 2009. The ethnic and
%cultural atmosphere in Hawaii is one of the most diverse on the planet. The
%University of Hawaii system not only attracts students internationally from
%Asia and from around the globe, but also serves as the hub of higher learning
%for minority students coming from nations in the Pacific Rim such as the
%Marshall Islands and Micronesia. In this cultural melting pot, instructors are
%required to effectively convey information in an inclusive and efficient way
%while understanding each of the students' cultures and needs as best as
%possible. For example, these needs may include supplemental instruction if
%English is not the student's primary language, or specific attention if the
%student comes from a background where STEM is not traditionally emphasized.
%
%In addition, my research has allowed me to live and work in various countries
%around the globe such as Japan and Italy giving me the opportunity to work with
%a wide range of ethnicities and cultures. For example, during my time in Japan,
%I volunteered to be a presenter to introduce and explain about the various
%research activities conducted by our neutrino experiment (KamLAND) to Japanese
%undergraduate students at Tohoku University. Through this event, I was able
%appeal to diversity by conveying the importance of international collaboration
%that our experiment requires to successfully operate the experiment.
%
%I believe that my multi-cultural upbringing and experiences working in very
%diverse teams of international collaborators, can significantly contribute to
%the spectrum of diversity and inclusive excellence that UCI cherishes.
