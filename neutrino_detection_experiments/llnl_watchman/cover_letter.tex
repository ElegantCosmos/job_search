As a budding and ambitious physicist, I am extremely interested in the
Postdoctoral Research Staff position in the fields of antineutrino and
radiation detection, Job ID \#103183. I would like to apply for the position.

My experience involves developing novel event track reconstruction and particle
ID techniques in monolithic scintillator (anti)neutrino detectors. Through my
work, I single handedly opened the doors to a never before explored capability
of scintillator detectors to conduct indirect dark matter
searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from the core of the Sun
and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the first ever physics
application of directional (anti)neutrino reconstruction in scintillator. A
paper for this is currently under preparation.

%I received my Ph.D. in experimental neutrino physics from the University of
%Hawaii at Manoa in May of 2016. During my graduate studies, I worked on event
%track reconstruction and particle ID techniques in KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid
%Scintillator Antineutrino Detector), a monolithic liquid scintillator neutrino
%detector in Kamioka, Japan. Through my work, I single handedly opened the doors
%to a never before explored capability of scintillator detectors to conduct
%indirect dark matter searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from
%the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the
%first ever physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in
%scintillator. A paper for this is currently under preparation.
%
%Nevertheless, topological event reconstruction in scintillator is fundamentally
%limited because the reconstruction is done using the smeared information of
%isotropically emitted scintillation photons collected by photomultiplier tubes
%(PMTs) along the perimeter of the detector volume. Liquid Argon
%Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) technology that will be used by the DUNE (Deep
%Underground Neutrino Experiment) detector at Sanford Lab is the next
%generation endeavor to employ topological event imaging at an unprecedented
%level of precision, using the ability to drift ionization charge to a read-out
%plane. Although there has been much effort to demonstrate the feasibility of
%the detector technology itself, development of reliable event imaging
%algorithms will be crucial to the success of DUNE. I believe that my experience
%with topological event imaging in an extremely difficult medium, such as
%scintillator, puts me in a unique position to play a leading role in the effort
%to develop reliable reconstruction algorithms in LArTPCs.

%In addition, throughout my academic career, I have been heavily involved in
%teaching and mentoring students. My philosophy for teaching is motivation
%through curiosity and mastering through repetition. When teaching at the
%undergraduate level, it is especially important to never get bogged down by the
%equation or numbers. When I begin a class or introduce a new concept to
%students, I never begin with equations. I always first show them the experiment
%itself or introduce the context in an illustrative way. This is to engage the
%students' interest and entice their curiosity to develop a long lasting
%motivation before starting to learn. Repetition is the key to mastering a
%topic. No matter how gifted one may be, no one able to master everything
%instantaneously in a single trial. On the other hand, this also means that even
%if one is not naturally gifted at something, it can be mastered through
%diligent repetition.

%In society today, there is an unfortunate misconception that Physics is a
%difficult subject and that it is only for \textit{smart} students. Nothing
%could be further from the truth. When students feel that they are not good
%enough or smart enough to follow the class, it is important to let them know
%that Physics is not about intelligence, but about curiosity driven diligence
%and hard work. All professional Physicists today stand on the shoulders of the
%giants of the past, and almost no research is done solely alone, but through
%collaboration and teamwork. No one is \textit{smart} enough to do all the work
%by one's self. I usually use myself as an example. I could not attend a leading
%world-class research institute during my undergraduate school days, but I
%believe through diligence and hard work, I have had the opportunity to work
%with some of the most talented and innovative Physicists in the field.

%In conclusion, my innovative endeavors in topological neutrino event
%reconstruction, as well as my experience in successfully teaching/mentoring
%students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, makes me a unique
%candidate to apply for your position. I believe I can make a significant impact
%to your team of academic and scientific prowess at SD School of Mines \&
%Technology.
