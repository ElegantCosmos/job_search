As a budding and ambitious physicist, I am extremely interested in the
Computational Physicist position in the Design Physics Division within the
Weapons and Complex Integration (WCI) Directorate, Job ID \#103186. I would
like to apply for the position.

Having spent much of my adolescent life between \num{1994} to \num{2005} in
South Korea, I witnessed first hand what it is like to live next to a communist
regime in times of both peace and stability as well as tension in the midst of
potential war. I strongly believe it is imperative that the United States be at
the top of its capability in understanding and exercising responsible
stewardship of its nuclear weapons capabilities.

%My experience involves developing novel event track reconstruction and particle
%ID techniques in monolithic scintillator (anti)neutrino detectors. Through my
%work, I single handedly opened the doors to a never before explored capability
%of scintillator detectors to conduct indirect dark matter
%searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from the core of the Sun
%and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the first ever physics
%application of directional (anti)neutrino reconstruction in scintillator. A
%paper for this is currently under preparation.

%I received my Ph.D. in experimental neutrino physics from the University of
%Hawaii at Manoa in May of 2016. During my graduate studies, I worked on event
%track reconstruction and particle ID techniques in KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid
%Scintillator Antineutrino Detector), a monolithic liquid scintillator neutrino
%detector in Kamioka, Japan. Through my work, I single handedly opened the doors
%to a never before explored capability of scintillator detectors to conduct
%indirect dark matter searches by looking for directional neutrino signals from
%the core of the Sun and Earth. According to my understanding, my work is the
%first ever physics application of directional neutrino reconstruction in
%scintillator. A paper for this is currently under preparation.
%
%Nevertheless, topological event reconstruction in scintillator is fundamentally
%limited because the reconstruction is done using the smeared information of
%isotropically emitted scintillation photons collected by photomultiplier tubes
%(PMTs) along the perimeter of the detector volume. Liquid Argon
%Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) technology that will be used by the DUNE (Deep
%Underground Neutrino Experiment) detector at Sanford Lab is the next
%generation endeavor to employ topological event imaging at an unprecedented
%level of precision, using the ability to drift ionization charge to a read-out
%plane. Although there has been much effort to demonstrate the feasibility of
%the detector technology itself, development of reliable event imaging
%algorithms will be crucial to the success of DUNE. I believe that my experience
%with topological event imaging in an extremely difficult medium, such as
%scintillator, puts me in a unique position to play a leading role in the effort
%to develop reliable reconstruction algorithms in LArTPCs.

%In addition, throughout my academic career, I have been heavily involved in
%teaching and mentoring students. My philosophy for teaching is motivation
%through curiosity and mastering through repetition. When teaching at the
%undergraduate level, it is especially important to never get bogged down by the
%equation or numbers. When I begin a class or introduce a new concept to
%students, I never begin with equations. I always first show them the experiment
%itself or introduce the context in an illustrative way. This is to engage the
%students' interest and entice their curiosity to develop a long lasting
%motivation before starting to learn. Repetition is the key to mastering a
%topic. No matter how gifted one may be, no one able to master everything
%instantaneously in a single trial. On the other hand, this also means that even
%if one is not naturally gifted at something, it can be mastered through
%diligent repetition.

%In society today, there is an unfortunate misconception that Physics is a
%difficult subject and that it is only for \textit{smart} students. Nothing
%could be further from the truth. When students feel that they are not good
%enough or smart enough to follow the class, it is important to let them know
%that Physics is not about intelligence, but about curiosity driven diligence
%and hard work. All professional Physicists today stand on the shoulders of the
%giants of the past, and almost no research is done solely alone, but through
%collaboration and teamwork. No one is \textit{smart} enough to do all the work
%by one's self. I usually use myself as an example. I could not attend a leading
%world-class research institute during my undergraduate school days, but I
%believe through diligence and hard work, I have had the opportunity to work
%with some of the most talented and innovative Physicists in the field.

%In conclusion, my innovative endeavors in topological neutrino event
%reconstruction, as well as my experience in successfully teaching/mentoring
%students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, makes me a unique
%candidate to apply for your position. I believe I can make a significant impact
%to your team of academic and scientific prowess at SD School of Mines \&
%Technology.
