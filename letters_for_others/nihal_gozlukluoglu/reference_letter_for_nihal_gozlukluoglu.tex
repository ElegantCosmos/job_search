\justifying

I am pleased to offer my recommendation for Nihal Gozlukluoglu to your academic
program. Nihal worked closely with me at the University of California, Los
Angeles during my post-doctoral work from September 2016 to June 2018 with the
CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) experiment under the
guidance of Professor Huan Z. Huang. During this time, I had the chance to
mentor Nihal while working on a project developing particle transport
simulation codes modeling the response of cryogenic bolometers to nuclear decay
products as well as the shielding of these detectors from ambient radiation
backgrounds to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. I was able to
personally witness her work routine and assess her future potential in
furthering her academic studies.

Nihal is a diligent student that works hard to learn concepts and apply them in
a research environment. She will quickly absorb new ideas and skills to perform
original work. During her time with me, she took on the task of investigating
case studies for employing various shielding schemes and materials for the
detectors using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo particle transport library. Her work has
provided valuable insight into potential improvements for the project toward
placing more aggressive limits on the decay rate of neutrinoless double beta
decay. Additionally, I would also like to highlight her ability to work
responsibly as a team player, and maintain a professional and friendly
relationship with both her mentors as well as her peers. She has a bright and
friendly personality and is liked by all in the research group.

I see Nihal having high potential for furthering her education and developing
as a professional researcher. I believe she can grow at any institution, but
she has chosen your particular program as the place to further her studies. I
am confident that her admission will be a decision you will not regret.

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have or to discuss my
recommendation in further detail. Please feel free to contact me at the
information provided below.
