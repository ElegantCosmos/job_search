I recently received word from our department chair, Prof. Jean Turner, of a potential Assistant Professorship position at California State University, Los Angeles. I would like to apply for the position.

I received my Ph.D. in experimental particle physics from the University of
Hawaii at Manoa in April, 2016. Throughout my academic career, I have been
heavily involved in teaching and mentoring students from a wide range of
backgrounds. This has included working as a teaching assistant during my
graduate studies where I led 2 undergraduate Physics Laboratory classes of over
20 students each for a total of 3 semesters. The ethnic and cultural atmosphere
in Hawaii is one of the most diverse on the planet. This requires instructors
to effectively convey information in an inclusive and efficient way while
understanding each of the students' cultures as best as possible. Student
evaluations for the effectiveness of my teaching and ability to communicate
were ``excellent''.

My current scholarly work as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) involves working with the CUORE (Cryogenic
Underground Observatory for Rare Events) $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment at LNGS
(Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso), Italy leading the effort on precision
modeling of the alpha background contamination of the detector. A paper for our
first $0\nu\beta\beta$ analysis using CUORE data was submitted for publication
to PRL in late 2017, and is currently under review
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07988).

Previously, I have also worked on event track reconstruction and particle ID
techniques in liquid scintillator at KamLAND (Kamioka Liquid Scintillator
Antineutrino Detector), a monolithic neutrino detector in Kamioka, Japan. My
work single handedly opened the doors for the unprecedented ability for
scintillator detectors to conduct dark matter searches by looking for a
directional signal of neutrinos from the core of planetary bodies. According to
my understanding, my work is the first ever physics application of directional
neutrino reconstruction in scintillator. A paper for this is currently under
preparation.

In conclusion, my experience mentoring undergraduate students from a wide range
of cultural backgrounds, and innovative endeavor with projects in 2 foreign
nations makes me a unique candidate to apply for your position. I believe
I can make a significant impact to your team of academic and scientific
prowess at California State University, Los Angeles.

Thank you for your consideration.
