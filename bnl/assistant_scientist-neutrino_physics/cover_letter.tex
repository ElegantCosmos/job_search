\justifying
As a motivated physicist, I am interested in joining the Electronic Detector
Group (EDG) in the Physics Department at the Brookhaven National Laboratory
(BNL).
I would like to apply for the advertised position of Assistant Scientist.

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California,
Berkeley with experience in detector simulation, data analysis, and design for
scintillator neutrino detectors and VUV optical wavelength shifters for LAr.

With regard to my ability to meet the specific requirements of this job:\\
